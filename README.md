# IPL Match Winner Prediction Website üèè  

Welcome to the IPL Match Winner Prediction Website! This project utilizes **Flask**, **Python**, **HTML**, and **CSS** alongside **GitHub Codespaces** to create and host an interactive web application for predicting the winning probabilities of IPL teams in a live match scenario.  

This tool offers a user-friendly interface where users can input match details and view real-time predictions powered by a machine learning model.  

For more details on the development of the prediction model, please refer to the following link:

### Demo  



## üèó **Technologies Used**  
- **Flask**: A lightweight and powerful Python web framework.  
- **Python**: The programming language driving the backend logic and prediction model.  
- **HTML & CSS**: To design a responsive and user-friendly web interface.  
- **GitHub Codespaces**: A cloud-powered development environment to streamline coding and hosting.  

## üöÄ **Getting Started with Flask in GitHub Codespaces**  
This project demonstrates the integration of **GitHub Codespaces** and **Flask** to build and host a web application that predicts IPL match outcomes.  

### Features  
- **Prediction Model**: Calculates the probabilities of winning for both the batting and bowling teams based on input parameters.  
- **Flask Framework**: Provides seamless backend operations for real-time predictions.  
- **GitHub Codespaces**: Offers an easy-to-setup cloud workspace for developing and hosting the project.  

## üõ† **How to Run This Project**  

1. **Open in GitHub Codespaces**:  
   Clone this repository or start a new Codespace from your GitHub repository.  

2. **Set Up Dependencies**:  
   Install the necessary Python packages (if not already installed):  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. **Run the Flask Application**:  
   Start the server using the following command:  
   ```bash  
   flask --debug run  
   ```  
   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.  

4. **Predict Match Outcomes**:  
   Input match details such as the batting team, bowling team, target score, and overs completed on the web interface to view the winning probabilities.
